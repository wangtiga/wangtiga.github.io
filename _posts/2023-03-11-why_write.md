# Why Write


https://fs.blog/why-write/


Why write an essay when you can type a few words and have AI generate one for you? Why write an email when AI can auto-respond for you with all the typical pleasantries and talking-points?

如果给AI敲几个字就能生成文字,你为什么还要亲自写文章?
如果AI能按特定话题(论点)生成符合规范(套话)的邮件,为什么还要亲自写电子邮件?


While AI doing these things for you is likely to happen, it’s not necessarily a good thing. Even when these tools exist, they are not a replacement for writing.

现在AI已经能做到这些事情了, 但这并不一定是件好事.
即使有这些东西存在,也不能代写作.


Writing is the process by which you realize that you do not understand what you are talking about. Importantly, writing is also the process by which you figure it out.

写作会让你发现自己并不理解要写的内容.
更重要的是,写作还能让你重新找到答案(理解这些内容).


Writing about something teaches you about what you know, what you don’t know, and how to think.
Writing about something is one of the best ways to learn about it.
Writing is not just a vehicle to share ideas with others but also a way to understand them better yourself.

写作能教会自己知道或不知道的知识, 也能教会自己如何思考.
写作是最好的学习方式.
写作不仅是给别人分享观点的工具,也是让自己更深入理解知识的方法.


Paul Graham put it this way: “A good writer doesn’t just think, and then write down what he thought, as a sort of transcript. A good writer will almost always discover new things in the process of writing.”

保罗格雷厄姆说过: "好的作者不会像录音机一样仅仅把自己的想法记录下来. 好的作者在每次写作过程都会有新的收获."


There is another important element to writing that often gets overlooked.
Writing requires the compression of an idea.
When done poorly, compression removes insights.
When done well, compression keeps the insights and removes the rest.
Compression requires both thinking and understanding, which is one reason writing is so important.

关于写作,还有一件人们经常忽略的事情.
写作过程要概括中心思想.
如果没概括好,就会失去观点.
如果概括得好,才能保留观点,移除杂质.
概括的过程需要良好的思考能力和理解能力,这就是写如此重要的原因.


Great writing requires you to position your idea in a way that will resonate with the reader.
Average writers start with what they want to say without considering how it will land with the reader.
Great writers understand the journey starts with what the reader desires.
Think of the difference as starting at the beginning or the end of a maze.
When you start at the beginning, you have to convince people the path is the right one.
When you start at the end, they already know you’re taking them where they want to go.

出色的写作需要以让读者产生共鸣为目的来定位观点.
普通作家只关注自己想要表达的内容,却没有考虑内容对读者的影响.
优秀的作家则理解到,阅读的旅程始于读者需求.
可以将这种差异类比为从迷宫的起点或终点开始.
当你从起点开始时,你必须说服人们这是正确的路径.
当你从终点开始时,读者知道你正在讨论他们想去的地方(会更容易产生共鸣).


In a world of average writing available on demand, every organization will start communicating like a big one.
The signal-to-noise ratio will change for the worse.
If you’ve ever read a government communication, you understand how a lot of words can say nothing.
Bandwidth will be filled with common ideas, verbose communication, and ambiguous jargon.
In the future, information will become even more of a substitute for thought than it already is.

当这种常规的写作能力随时都能轻易获取时,每个组织都会像大公司一样进行沟通(因为用工具生成车轱辘话很容易,会有更多小公司愿意用工具生成充满意敬语格式的邮件,让自己显得更专业).
信噪比会变差(因为车轱辘话越来越多).
如果你看过政客间的对话,就能理解 "说了很多话,但又好像什么话都没说" 是什么意思了(没有信息量).
交流内容中会充斥大量常规想法,冗长的沟通和模糊的行话.
未来，信息会越来越多地代思考 (人们会更愿意 靠工具直接获取答案, 而不是 靠思考来推理结论 来解决问题).


Many things can be done by tools that write for you, but they won’t help you learn to think or understand a problem with deep fluency.
And you need deep fluency to solve hard problems.

有许多事情可以通过工具辅助完成，但它们无法帮助你学会思考或深入理解问题。
而你需要深入理解才能解决复杂的问题。


A world of common thinking available on demand will tempt people to outsource their thinking and disproportionately reward people who don’t.
 In the future, clear thinking will become more valuable, not less.

当这种常规思考能力随时能轻易获取时,
这些不爱思考的人,会成倍的获得不思考带来的便利和好处,
这会诱使人们更少独立思考,凡事都外包出去,让工具代自己思考 (人们会更愿意用工辅助思考,简单问题直接让工具处理后给出一个答案就行,自己不再思考).
所以未来清晰的思考能力会变得更有价值,而非更没价值 (因为思考的人变少,有脑子,会思考的人更少了).
